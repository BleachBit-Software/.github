## What is BleachBit?

**BleachBit** is a popular open-source system cleaning utility designed to help users **free up disk space**, **delete temporary files**, and **protect privacy**. It works by scanning your system for unnecessary files—such as browser cache, logs, cookies, and temporary data—and safely removing them. Unlike many commercial cleaners, BleachBit is completely free, transparent, and trusted by security experts and everyday users alike.

With BleachBit, you can:
- Reclaim valuable disk space by deleting junk files.
- Clean browser history, cookies, and cached data for privacy.
- Remove broken shortcuts and unused registry entries (Windows).
- Securely overwrite sensitive files to prevent recovery.
- Automate cleaning tasks with scheduled runs.

BleachBit is especially useful for users who want to maintain their system’s performance without installing bloated software. It supports a wide range of applications, including browsers like Chrome and Firefox, system tools, and third-party software.
